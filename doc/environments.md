# Vision

> As openAgile, we want our build, test, and deployment for CommitStream to be as automated as possible, so that we can maximize the amount of time we spend responding to customer demand and delivering new functionality, and minimize the amount of time troubleshooting cumbersome, error-prone processes.

# Environments and branches

See [resources.md](resources.md) for the deployment view of the system.
